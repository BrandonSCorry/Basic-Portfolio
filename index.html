          Hello and welcome to my portfolio in progress. My name is Brandon and I enjoy long walks on the beach, going to bingo, and writing biographies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just kidding, I don't like any of those things! I've been making basic websites since adolescence - bringing <i>HTML GOODIES</i> and some PHP 4 book I've long forgotten almost everywhere I went. Visiting my grandparents was a treat as I'd get to hop on their Windows NT 3.1 machine and go to town.
        </p>

        <p>
          The highest level of education I've completed up to now is a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy from Virginia Commonwealth University. I've freelanced as a front-end web developer for the past couple of years. Making basic websites out of html, css, and some javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently trying to get out of the 'cave' and learn modern javascript frameworks, libraries, and everything that goes with it to become a more capable developer. My means of achieving this goal are through attending The George Washington University Full-Stack Coding Boot Camp, reading as many technical books as I can get my hands on, and completing online courses and tutorials.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my time off I like to ride my bike, go camping, and hang out with my dog Buffy - but I usually end up having to fix my old Saab... again.
